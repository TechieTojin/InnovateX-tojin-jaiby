# Build an AI-Powered Expense Tracker App

This guide will help you structure your AI-powered expense tracker with detailed steps, covering all functionalities, screens, and implementation.

## 1. App Overview
Managing expenses manually is difficult, so this app will use AI to automatically categorize expenses, provide real-time spending insights, and offer budget recommendations.

The app will have the following core features:

- User authentication (login/signup)
- Expense tracking with AI categorization
- Receipt scanning with OCR
- Bank statement import and parsing
- Visual insights with graphs and charts
- Budget management and alerts

## 2. Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Define the Project Scope & UI/UX Design
Start by designing wireframes for each screen. Keep the UI minimal and intuitive with a dashboard-based approach for quick access to insights.

**Screens to design:**

- Splash Screen – App intro with animation.
- Login/Signup Screen – Authentication with Google, Facebook, or email.
- Home Dashboard – Overview of total expenses, income, and budget progress.
- Add Expense Screen – Manual entry with AI-based categorization.
- Expense List Screen – Shows all past transactions, categorized.
- Expense Details Screen – Detailed breakdown of any single expense.
- AI Receipt Scanner Screen – Camera-based receipt scanning to auto-add expenses.
- Bank Statement Import Screen – Upload CSV or PDF for auto-parsing transactions.
- Budget Management Screen – Set monthly budgets and track spending.
- Spending Insights Screen – Charts, graphs, and AI-generated reports.
- Notifications Screen – Alerts when overspending happens.
- Profile & Settings Screen – Update user preferences, financial goals.

Use Figma or Adobe XD for designing UI wireframes before coding.

### Step 2: Set Up Project & Dependencies
- Android (Jetpack Compose) or React Native for front-end.
- Firebase (for authentication & real-time data storage).
- Google Vision API / Tesseract OCR (for receipt scanning).
- Python (TensorFlow/Keras) for AI-based expense categorization.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for budget alerts.

Set up your Firebase project, enable authentication (Google/Email), and configure Firestore Database for real-time data storage.

### Step 3: Implement Authentication & User Profile
**Integrate Firebase Authentication**
- Allow Google Sign-In, Facebook, and email authentication.
- On successful login, store user data in Firestore (name, email, income details).

**User Profile Setup**
- Users enter basic details like monthly income, savings goal, and budget preferences.
- Store profile data in Firestore for personalized recommendations.

### Step 4: Build Expense Tracking System
**Manual Expense Entry**
- Create a form for entering expense details (amount, category, date, payment method).
- Use autocomplete to suggest common expenses.
- Save data to Firestore with proper indexing for quick retrieval.

**AI-Based Categorization**
- Train an AI model to classify expenses into categories like Food, Transport, Rent, Shopping, Entertainment.
- Use a pre-trained NLP model to analyze expense descriptions.
- Auto-assign categories when users enter new transactions.

### Step 5: Implement AI-Based Receipt Scanner
**Use OCR for Text Extraction**
- Use Google Vision API or Tesseract OCR to scan receipts.
- Extract merchant name, amount, date, and items from receipt images.
- Convert extracted text into structured expense data.

**AI Matching for Categorization**
- Train an AI model to identify expense categories based on receipt content.
- If confidence is low, ask the user for confirmation before saving.

### Step 6: Implement Bank Statement Import
**Allow Users to Upload CSV/PDF**
- Let users upload bank statements in CSV/PDF format.
- Use Python Pandas or Firebase Functions to parse transactions.

**Auto-Categorize Transactions**
- Match transaction descriptions with predefined AI models.
- Classify expenses based on merchant name, keywords, and patterns.

**Display Imported Data in a Table**
- Show all parsed transactions in a review screen before adding to the database.

### Step 7: Build Budget & Spending Insights Module
**Set Budget Limits for Each Category**
- Let users define monthly limits for categories (e.g., ₹5000 for groceries).
- Store budget settings in Firestore.

**Real-Time Spending Alerts**
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions to send alerts when spending exceeds budget.
- Enable push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

**AI-Based Budget Suggestions**
- AI suggests realistic budget limits based on past spending trends.
- Provide personalized recommendations (e.g., "You are overspending on dining out").

### Step 8: Implement Insights & Analytics Dashboard
**Show Spending Patterns with Charts**
- Use MPAndroidChart (for Android) or Recharts (for React Native).
- Display Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, and Line Charts to visualize spending.

**Category-wise Breakdown**
- Show which categories consume the most budget (e.g., Food 40%, Rent 30%).
- AI highlights unusual spending spikes.

**Compare Monthly Spending Trends**
- Display month-to-month comparisons using bar charts.
- Show savings progress over time.

### Step 9: Implement Notification System
**Spending Alerts & Budget Warnings**
- Notify users when they approach their budget limits.
- Send alerts for large transactions (e.g., "₹10,000 spent on Electronics").

**AI-Based Financial Tips**
- Periodically send personalized saving tips (e.g., "Try reducing food delivery expenses").
- Use Firebase Functions to schedule weekly/monthly reports.

### Step 10: Profile & Settings Management
**Allow Users to Update Personal Details**
- Income, savings goals, spending preferences.
- Enable dark mode/theme switching for better UX.

**Security & Backup Options**
- Enable data export (CSV, JSON) for users to download transactions.
- Provide Google Drive backup integration.

## Final Steps: Testing, Deployment & Maintenance

**Test All Features**
- Perform manual testing and AI validation.
- Ensure OCR accuracy, budget alerts, and AI categorization are working fine.

**Deploy on Play Store & Web**
- Optimize UI for Android & iOS (if using React Native).
- Deploy backend APIs on Firebase Functions / AWS Lambda.

**Maintenance & Future Updates**
- Regularly train AI models with new expense patterns.
- Add multi-currency support for international users.

## Implementation Details for Trackyyy

### Integration with Existing Codebase
To integrate these AI-powered features with the existing Trackyyy app:

1. **Update the MVVM Architecture**:
   - Create new ViewModels for AI processing features
   - Implement repositories for handling ML model interactions

2. **Add AI Dependencies to build.gradle.kts**:
   ```kotlin
   // ML dependencies
   implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.9.0")
   implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-support:0.4.2")
   implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-mlkit-text-recognition:18.0.2")
   ```

3. **ML Model Integration**:
